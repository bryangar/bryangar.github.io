								<h2 class="major">About Me</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Bryan.jpg" alt="Bryan's picture"  height="450px"/></span>
								<p> 
									<br>  I always thought my dream was to be an accountant in one of the Big 4s as that seemed to be the obvious career path 
									for accounting students. Not until I arrive in Melbourne 4 years ago, that I began to uncover my personal aspirations and took on other career choices. 
									</br>
									<br> Never would I have imagined myself to be sitting behind my laptop all day, coding, decoding and encoding to get a website up to speed. 
									Since I began my Bachelor in Business IT, I could not stop myself from diving deeper into the technology space. My curiosity got the better of me and 
									I did my first freelance job to help someone to build his professional website just a week into learning programming. 
									</br>
									<br> Now, I can effectively design a webpage using Github and plays with Python, CSS, HTML5, JavaScript, and MySQL day and night.
									I also have knowledge using Wireshark, SAS Visual Analytic, IBM cloud, Node Red, App Inventor, Blender, GIMP and Unity. 
									</br>
									<br> On days when I feel like being less geeky, I would put on my property glasses and check out the real estate market. Since I used to be a proud Superhost of 6 apartments,
									 I am still hoping that the day would come that I can get back onto this business.
									</br>
		
									<br> I am the colleague which everyone would look to when they need an answer. It brings a huge joy to me knowing that I am able to enrich someone’s life or help someone in need. 
									I enjoy making new friends and hearing new perspectives. I am highly inquisitive and constantly searching for new things to learn and challenge myself. 
									</br>
									<br> I would like to be able to create more amazing websites for people and businesses because that is where my passion lies in. If you are interested to know more about me and my skills, feel free to reach out.
